# MeetBot

MeetBot is an intelligent automation tool designed to streamline interactions in Google Meet. It automates the process of joining meetings, capturing captions, recording screen and audio streams, and processing meeting data for insights. Powered by **Selenium WebDriver**, browser APIs, and the **Hugging Face AI**, MeetBot is a robust solution for managing virtual meetings efficiently.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- A compatible version of Google Chrome and ChromeDriver.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meetbot.git
   cd meetbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up ChromeDriver**:
   - Download the correct version of [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) for your Chrome browser.
   - Place the driver in your system's PATH.

4. **Configure environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Hugging Face API key:
     ```
     HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_api_key
     ```

5. **Ensure directories exist**:
   - The bot will save recordings in `public/Videos`. Ensure this directory exists or will be created automatically.

## Usage

### Running the Server

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Endpoint for Meet Automation**:
   - Send a `POST` request to the `/api/open-google-meet` endpoint with the following JSON body:
     ```json
     {
       "meetLink": "https://meet.google.com/your-meeting-link",
       "targetUser": "John Doe"
     }
     ```
   - The `targetUser` specifies the name of the participant whose departure triggers the automation to stop.

## How It Works

1. **Meeting Workflow**:
   - The bot navigates to the Google Meet link and fills in a bot name.
   - It requests to join the meeting and handles pop-ups.
   - Starts capturing captions and recording the screen/audio.

2. **Dynamic Monitoring**:
   - Continuously checks if the specified user (`targetUser`) has left the meeting.
   - Stops all tasks (recording, caption capturing) once the user leaves.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Captured captions are saved in a structured JSON format.
   - Hugging Face's AI generates a concise summary of the meeting.
   - All recordings and processed data are stored locally for review.

## Configuration

You can adjust settings like screen size, recording preferences, or meeting link dynamically. For example:
```typescript
await driver.manage().window().setRect({ width: 1080, height: 720 });
await driver.get('https://meet.google.com/your-meet-code');
```

- **Productivity Booster**:
  - Generate actionable summaries to reduce the need for manual note-taking.
- **Virtual Assistant**:
  - Manage repetitive Google Meet interactions seamlessly.

## Output Files

1. **Captions JSON**:
   - Stored in the root directory as `captions.json`.
   - Includes a predefined heading for summarization and structured captions.

2. **Meeting Summary**:
   - Generated by Hugging Face AI and saved as `summary.txt`.

3. **Screen Recording**:
   - Saved as `public/Videos/screen_recording.webm`.
